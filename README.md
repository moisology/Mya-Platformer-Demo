# Mya-Platformer-Demo

This is my first completed Unity Project

The project uses 3D Blender models across a 2D space. 
I opted for low-poly models due to my system's limitations.

My goal in this project was to achieve complexity through simplicity.
The game only has one attack button alongside movement.
With this I was able to create 4 different attacking actions for the player.
I also added variety in the projectiles available to the player.

This demo is part of a greater personal project currently under development.
